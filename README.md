### Hi there 👋

I'm a 23-year-old Computer Science graduate, passionate about development, technology, and turning ideas into real applications. I currently work at two companies:

- 👨‍💻 **Full-Stack Developer at ReadyLoans** – building robust web applications and currently developing an automated AI system to streamline internal workflows.
- 📱 **Mobile Developer at Nuwatt** – working on a new Flutter app with a focus on cross-platform performance and modern UI/UX.

✅ **Capstone Project Complete**  
My capstone project is now fully developed and deployed, marking a personal milestone in delivering real-world functionality.

🧠 **Always Learning**  
I'm committed to staying updated with the latest in tech, from new frameworks to best practices in clean architecture, scalability, and performance.

🤝 **Open to Collaboration**  
I'm always interested in challenging full-stack or mobile projects that push the boundaries of what I know and help me grow.
